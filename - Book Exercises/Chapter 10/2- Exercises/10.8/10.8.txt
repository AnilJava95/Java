-Abstract classes are mostly just classes. The only difference is, at least one method 
is abstract (has no implementation). This means this abstract class can't be instantiated.
Classes who extend this abstract class can be abstract or concrete. Concrete classes 
are classes that have no abstract methods.

Interfaces are not similar to classes. Interfaces can only have static final 
variables. Interfaces can only have abstract methods.

We use abstract classes when a class is an object of another class. And we use interfaces 
when a class does a set of functions. With the introduction of Java SE 8, interfaces now 
have default and static methods.
