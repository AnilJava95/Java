-When we use protected access modifier, we open up the members to other classes 
in the same package and subclasses in other packages. We wouldnt want other 
classes changing our variables directly. That wouldnt be robust programming.
Using private access modifier for sensitive variables and adding public or 
protected service methods is a better programming practice.
