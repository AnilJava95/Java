3.3-

Local variables;

   Are declared inside methods, 
   Last as long as the method,
   Their scope is their method,
   They are not initialized. 

Instance variables;
	
   Are declared outside methods and inside a class,
   Last as long as the object,
   Their scope depends on their access modifiers and methods that interface them 
    to outside world,
   They are initialized.

3.4- Method calls are the way we call methods. Some methods need additional input 
to do their job. For example we need operands to add if we have an addition method. 
So these values we give to method at method call are called arguments. Arguments 
are assigned to local variables in methods called parameters.
