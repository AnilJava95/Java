3.3-

Local variables;

   Are declared inside methods, 
   Last as long as the method,
   Their scope is their method,
   They are not initialized. 

Instance variables;
	
   Are declared outside methods and inside class,
   Last as long as the object,
   Their scope depends on their access modifiers and methods that interface them to outside world,
   They are initialized.

3.4- Method calls are the way we call methods. When we call methods some of them need additional data to 
 do their job. For example we need operands to add if we have an addition methods. So these values we 
 give to method at method call are called arguments. Argument values are assigned to local variables in 
 methods called parameters.
