-Before Java SE 8, just adding new methods to an interface would give an error 
since you didn't implement those new methods in classes that implemented this 
interface. But with Java SE 8, we can add a new method to our interface and 
we can supply a default implementation for this method so classes that don't 
implement this new method don't immediately break.
