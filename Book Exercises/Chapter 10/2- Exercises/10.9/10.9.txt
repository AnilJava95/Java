-Before Java SE 8, just adding new methods to an interface would give an error 
 since you didnt implement those new methods in classes that implemented this 
 interface. But with Java SE 8, we can add a new method to our interface and 
 we can supply a default implementation for this method so classes that dont 
 implement this new method dont immediately break.
