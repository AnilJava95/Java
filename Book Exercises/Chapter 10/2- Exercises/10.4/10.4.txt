-Overloaded constructors is a good example to polymorphism in overloading. We can have a 
 time class that hides how it implements time. We dont know if it keeps time as seconds 
 or minutes or hours or something else. But we have public services we can use to set and 
 get time. When we create time objects, we can create time using only hours, minutes and 
 hours, seconds and minutes and hours or using another time object. No matter which 
 overloaded constructor we execute, our time will be set.
