-Overloaded constructors are a good example of polymorphism in overloading. We can have a 
time class that hides how it implements time. We don't know if it keeps time as seconds 
or minutes or hours or something else. But we have public services we can use to set and 
get time. When we create time objects, we can create time using only hours, only minutes 
and hours, only seconds, minutes, and hours, or another time object. No matter which 
overloaded constructor we execute, our time will be set.
