-Abstract classes are mostly just classes. The only difference is, at least one method 
 is abstract(has no implementation). This means this abtract class can't be instantiated.
 Classes who extend this abstract class can be abstract or concrete. Concrete classes 
 are classes that have no abstract methods.

 Interfaces are not this similar to normal classes. Interfaces can only have static final 
 variables. Interfaces can only have abstract methods.

 Before Java SE 8, we used to use abstract class when a class was an object of another 
 class. And we used to use interfaces when a class did a set of functions. But with the 
 introduction of Java SE 8, interfaces now have default feature and static methods feature.
 So the difference between them got smaller.
