1.7-

A Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a feature of the run-time interpreter, that instead of interpreting bytecode every 
 time a method is invoked, will compile the bytecode into the machine code instructions of the running machine, and 
 then invoke this object code instead. Ideally the efficiency of running object code will overcome the inefficiency 
 of recompiling the program every time it runs.

-Object -> One of the wrist watches that was created.

-Attributes -> Size, color, material, shape, price.

-Behaviours(methods) -> Move time forward, backward, lights on/off, adjust brightness, set alarm, clear alarm, adjust 
 wrist size, get/set time.

-Class -> Design of the wrist watch.

-Inheritence -> Taking design of wrist watch and designing a new type of watch like an alarm clock.

-Encapsulation -> A watch contains its own data and functions.

-Interface -> The list of behaviours a watch can do. These behaviours can be implemented(done) in different ways in
 different watch models.

-Information hiding -> All watches know their own time. they dont know other watch's time.
