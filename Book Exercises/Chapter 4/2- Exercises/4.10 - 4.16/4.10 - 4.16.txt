4.10- If-else does one set of action(s) if the condition is true, another set of action(s) 
 of the condition is false. While executes its block as long as the condition is true.

4.11- Fraction gets truncated. In order to get rid of this problem we need to cast one of 
 the operands to a floating point type which will implicitly cast the other operands to that 
 floating point type.

4.12- 

-Stacking -> They work one after another.
-Nesting -> They work inside each other.

4.13- 

-Sentinel-repetition -> First one: Enter as many values as you want.
-Counter-controlled -> Second one: Enter a fixed amount of numbers.

4.14-  

   x = 7;
   y = 3;
   x = y++;   // x = 3, y = 4 

   x = 7;
   y = 3;
   x = ++y;   //  x = 4, y = 4

4.15- 

a) line 1: semi colon, line 4: quote at the end
b) line 1: == -> =, line 4: total ++x;
c) Not having brackets cause infinite loop.
d) No closing bracer, infinite loop.

4.16) Y is: 12 and total is 78
