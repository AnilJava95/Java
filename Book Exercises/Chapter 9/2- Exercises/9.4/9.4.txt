-Inheritance enables us to not write the same variables and methods multiple times. 
 If we want more variables for the more specialized subclass then we only write those. 
 If we want more methods or same methods with more features we add new methods or 
 override existing ones. Even when we are overriding methods we generally first call 
 super.method and then add some more features. Same thing with constructors.
