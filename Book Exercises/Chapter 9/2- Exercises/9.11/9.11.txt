-One way the keyword super can be used is calling constructor of superclass.
This has to be the first thing to do in the subclass constructor. A second way 
we can use the keyword super is calling a member of superclass that is being 
hidden/overridden by a subclass member.

Calling constructor of superclass makes sure inherited variables are set 
correctly. And using super.memberName allows us to use non-private members of 
superclass.
