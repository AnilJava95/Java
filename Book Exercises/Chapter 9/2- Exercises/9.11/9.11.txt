-One way the keyword super can be used is calling constructor of superclass.
 This has to be the first thing to do in a subclass constructor. A second way 
 we can use the keyword super is calling a member of superclass that is being 
 shadowed by a subclass member.

 Calling constructor of superclass makes sure inherited variables are set 
 correctly. And using super.methodName lets us get rid of duplicate code.
