-Using get methods makes it so we are not dependent on implementation. We are 
decoupled. We can change implementation of how the date is kept however we want 
as long as we keep giving the services we gave before. Other programs can keep 
using these services to get what they need without caring how its implemented.

Also it is safer since we keep the variables private which means other classes 
cant access it and change it. They have to go though the secure public methods.
