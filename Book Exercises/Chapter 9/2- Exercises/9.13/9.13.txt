-Using get methods makes it so we are not dependent in implementation. We are 
 decoupled. We can change implementation of how the date is kept however we want 
 as long as we keep giving the services we gave before. Other programs can keep 
 using these services to get what they need without caring how its implemented.
 Makes it easier for the user of the service and makes it more secure.
