-InputMismatchException. To handle this exception, we would put input statement in a try block 
and output an error message in catch block so user can try again with right values.

-IndexOutOfBoundsException. This exception typically can be prevented with good coding. We could 
either use advanced for statement. We could use the ".length" method. But even with the ".length" 
method, we need to carefully set array bounds to not step outside it.

-ArithmeticException. This exception, like the IndexOutOfBounds exception, can be prevented via 
good programming. For example you can check whether a denoimnator is zero or not before using 
it.

-IllegalArgumentException. Like the InputMismatchException, we could put the method call in a try 
block and print an error message so the user can try again with correct values.

-NullPointerException. We could display the user an error message and tell user that this 
object does not exist.
