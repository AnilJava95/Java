-InputMismatchException. To handle this exception, we would put input statement in a try block 
and output an error message in catch block so user can try again with right values.

-IndexOutOfBoundsException. This exception typically can be prevented with good coding. We could 
either use advanced for statement. We could use the length method. 

-ArithmeticException. This exception, like the IndexOutOfBounds exception, can be prevented via 
good programming. For example you can check whether a denominator is zero or not before using 
it.

-IllegalArgumentException. Like the InputMismatchException, we could put the method call in a try 
block and print an error message so the user can try again with correct values.

-NullPointerException. We can see if the pointer is null before using it and display the user 
an error message that this object does not exist.
